Frontend
The frontend of this project is built using React and Chart.js for data visualization. It interacts with the Flask backend to display and modify data.

Frontend Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Frontend Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies for the React frontend. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
The key dependencies include:

axios: For making HTTP requests to the Flask backend.
react-chartjs-2: For rendering charts in the app.
chart.js: A charting library for data visualization.
react-router-dom: For navigation between different pages.
Running the Frontend
To run the frontend in development mode:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This command will start the development server at http://localhost:3000.

Backend
The backend is powered by Flask, with Flask SQLAlchemy as the ORM, and connects to a PostgreSQL database.

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ../backend
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Backend Dependencies
Here are some key dependencies for the Flask backend:

Flask: The main web framework.
Flask-SQLAlchemy: ORM for handling database operations.
Flask-Migrate: For database migrations.
Flask-CORS: To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for frontend-backend communication.
psycopg2-binary: PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
Database Setup
Set up PostgreSQL:

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed. Create a new database and update the configuration in your config.py file in the backend:

python
Copy code
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/yourdbname'
Run migrations to set up the database schema:

bash
Copy code
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade
Running the Backend
To run the backend server locally, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
flask run
The backend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Deployment
If you want to deploy the app, here are some general guidelines:

Choose a platform: For deployment, you can use platforms such as Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

Frontend Deployment: Build the frontend using:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Deploy the build files on a static hosting service like Netlify or GitHub Pages.

Backend Deployment: Host the Flask app on Heroku or similar, ensuring that PostgreSQL is set up for the production environment.

For Heroku:

Install the Heroku CLI and log in.
Push your backend app to Heroku.
Use Herokuâ€™s PostgreSQL add-on for the database.
bash
Copy code
heroku create
git push heroku main
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
Usage
Navigating the App:
Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, open the app in your browser at:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
You can perform the following actions:

View and modify data: Use the buttons on the Overview page to navigate to different sections (attendance, finance, enrollment, etc.) to modify the data.
Visual overview: The app displays charts with data visualization for different categories.
